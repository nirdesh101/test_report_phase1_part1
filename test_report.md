# 1️⃣ Introduction

## Tester(s):
Name: Nirdesh Pokharel

## Purpose:
The purpose of this penetration test is to identify vulnerabilities in the Booking System (Phase 1) registration flow and related HTTP security configurations using automated scanning tools (OWASP ZAP).

## Scope:
### Tested components:
- Homepage (`GET /`)
- Registration page (`GET /register`)
- Static assets (`/static/index.js`)
- HTTP response headers

### Exclusions:
- Admin features
- Backend source code
- Database-level testing
- DoS / brute-force / performance testing

### Test approach:
**Black-box testing**  
(Only interacted with the running app using browser + OWASP ZAP)

### Test environment & dates:
Start: 25 Nov 2025  
End: 25 Nov 2025  

### Test environment details:
- OS: macOS (running Docker)
- Browser: Safari / Microsoft Edge for Mac
- Tools: OWASP ZAP v2.16.1
- Application runtime: Docker container (BookingSystem Phase 1)
- Target URL: http://localhost:8000

### Assumptions & constraints:
- Application intentionally contains vulnerabilities for learning
- No authenticated test accounts were required
- Limited to features available in Phase 1

# 2️⃣ Executive Summary

## Short summary:
The automated ZAP scan identified four vulnerabilities — primarily missing HTTP security headers and lack of CSRF protection on the registration page.

## Overall risk level:
**Medium**

## Top 5 immediate actions:
1. Implement CSRF tokens for all form submissions.
2. Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
3. Add Anti-clickjacking headers (`X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors`).
4. Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
5. Review server configuration to ensure secure headers are consistently applied.

# 3️⃣ Severity Scale & Definitions

| Severity | Description | Recommended Action |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|
| 🔴 High | Serious vulnerability allowing full compromise (e.g., SQL Injection, RCE). | Fix immediately |
| 🟠 Medium | Requires some conditions or user interaction (e.g., XSS, CSRF). | Fix ASAP |
| 🟡 Low | Minor issue or weakness (e.g., missing headers). | Fix soon |
| 🔵 Info | No direct risk, informational. | Monitor |

# 4️⃣ Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Description | Evidence |
|----|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| F-01 | 🟠 Medium | Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set | Server responses do not include a `Content-Security-Policy` header. This increases risk of XSS and malicious script injection. | ZAP: “Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set” — GET http://localhost:8000/ |
| F-02 | 🟠 Medium | Missing Anti-clickjacking Header | Application does not set `X-Frame-Options` or CSP `frame-ancestors`, allowing clickjacking attacks. | ZAP: “Missing Anti-clickjacking Header” — GET http://localhost:8000/ |
| F-03 | 🟠 Medium | Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens | Registration page does not contain CSRF protection tokens, making it vulnerable to CSRF abuse. | ZAP: “Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens” — GET http://localhost:8000/register |
| F-04 | 🟡 Low | X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing | JavaScript file served without the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, enabling MIME-type confusion. | ZAP: “X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing” — GET http://localhost:8000/static/index.js |
